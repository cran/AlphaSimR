\title{Add Structured SNP chips}
\arguments{
\item{nSnpPerChr}{number of SNPs per chromosome. 
Can be a single value or nChr values.}

\item{structure}{a matrix.  Rows are snp chips, columns are chips.
If value is true then that snp is on that chip.}

\item{force}{should the check for a running simulation be 
ignored. Only set to TRUE if you know what you are doing.}
}
\description{
Randomly selects the number of snps in structure and then
assigns them to chips based on structure
}
\section{Usage}{
 SP$addStructuredSnpChip(nSnpPerChr, structure, force = FALSE)
}
